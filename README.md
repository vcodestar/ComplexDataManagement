# Group-by with Aggregation, Merge Join, and Composite Query

This repository contains three Python programs that perform various database operations on CSV files.

## Part 1: Group-by with Aggregation

This program reads a CSV file, groups by a specified attribute, performs an aggregation function (sum, min, or max), and writes the results to `O1.csv`.


## Part 2: Merge join

This program reads two sorted CSV files (R.csv and S.csv), performs a natural join on them, and writes the results to O2.csv.

## Part 3: Composite Query

This program reads two CSV files, filters R.csv based on a condition (R.C = 7), performs a join with S.csv, computes an aggregate (sum of S.E), and writes the results to O3.csv.
